# Fake Account Generator for Scammer Website  

This Python script is designed to generate and register **fake accounts** on a scammer website that falsely claims to offer work opportunities in exchange for money. The goal of this script is to overwhelm the scammer's database by generating a large number of fake accounts, eventually leading to a system crash or making their database unusable.

## üîß Configuration  

If you need to change the target website or headers, modify the `URL` and `headers` inside the `post_request()` function in `main.py`:

```python
URL = "https://lerih3.cc/api/user/register"

headers = {
    "Host": "lerih3.cc",
    "Cookie": "think_lang=en-us; PHPSESSID=e5b98f7fff3342a73525130bb2d2b10d",
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0",
    ...
}
```

## üöÄ Usage  

To run the script and start generating fake accounts, simply execute the script using the following command:
- Create the Virtual Environment (Not Necessary but Recommand) and activate it.
    ```bash
        # For Windows User
        python -m venv venv
        venv\Scripts\activate

        #For Linux User
        python3 -m virtualenv venv
        source venv/bin/activate

    ```
- Install the Requirements
    ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- Run the `main.py` file

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

The script will continuously generate random fake accounts and send them to the target website.

## üí° How It Works  

1. **Random Data Generation**:  
   The script uses the `Faker` library as well as custom function to generate random user data, including usernames, mobile numbers, passwords, and machine IDs.

2. **Data Encoding**:  
   The generated data is first converted to a JSON string, URL-encoded, and then Base64-encoded to match the server's expected format.

3. **HTTP Request**:  
   The encoded data is sent to the scammer's API endpoint using a POST request with appropriate headers to mimic a legitimate user.

4. **Continuous Execution**:  
   The script can run indefinitely, continuously sending fake account registrations to overload the scammer's system.

## üéØ Objectives  

- **Flood the scammer's database** with thousands of fake accounts.
- **Disrupt** their operations by consuming server resources.
- **Overwhelm** their system to reduce their ability to scam unsuspecting victims.

---

## üìå Important Notes  

- The script does not store any data locally or create persistent accounts.  
- The target website might implement rate limiting or other countermeasures. Use appropriate methods to bypass such restrictions if necessary (e.g., rotating IP addresses with proxies).  
- Be aware that the target may log incoming requests and take actions against your IP address.
